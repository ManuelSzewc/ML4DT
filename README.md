A repository for the ML4DT work done with Ezequiel Alvarez and Federico Lamagna
 
In this repository we include the necessary files to reproduce plots present in our work /..arxiv-id/

The main components are:
-Selecting the "treatment function" f
-Selecting the number of drug trials and patients for the Regular Drug Therapy (RDT)
-Setting the hyperparameters of the Neural Network
