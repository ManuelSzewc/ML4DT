# ML4DT
A repository for the ML4DT work done by Ezequiel Alvarez, Federico Lamagna and Manuel Szewc
 
In this repository we include the necessary files to reproduce plots present in our work /..arxiv-id/

The main components are:

-Selecting the "treatment function" H

-Selecting the number of drug trials and patients for the Regular Drug Therapy (RDT)

-Setting the hyperparameters of the Neural Network
